5. **Generate Natural Response**

This is a demonstration of what happens WITHOUT proper LLM integration.

1. Understand your question: "{question}"
2. Decide what to search for using its language understanding
3. Call MCP tools based on semantic comprehension
4. Generate responses from actual understanding of book content

**To enable proper MCP usage:**
- Use Claude Desktop with MCP support
- Or integrate with OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- Or use any LLM that supports tool calling

The whole point of MCP is to give LLMs access to external tools
while preserving their natural language understanding capabilities!

Without an LLM, we would have to fall back to keyword extraction,
which defeats the purpose of MCP.
